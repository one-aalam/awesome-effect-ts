# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to awesome-effect-ts! This document outlines the guidelines for submitting contributions to ensure high quality and consistency.

## How to Contribute

### Adding Resources

1. **One resource per pull request** - This makes it easier to review and discuss individual additions
2. **Use the following format**: `[name](link) - Brief description explaining what makes this resource unique`
3. **Add new resources to the end of the relevant category** - Don't worry about alphabetical order
4. **Include a description** that explains what the resource is and why it's useful

### Quality Standards

Resources should meet the following criteria:

#### General Requirements
- **Active maintenance** - No abandoned projects (updated within the last 6 months for libraries, 1 year for articles)
- **High quality** - Well-documented, tested, and follows best practices
- **Relevant to Effect-TS** - Directly related to or built for the Effect ecosystem
- **English language** - All resources should be in English or have English documentation
- **Free access** - Prefer free resources over paid ones (paid resources require strong justification)

#### For Libraries and Tools
- **Minimum 50+ GitHub stars** (exceptions for very new but promising projects)
- **Clear documentation** with examples
- **TypeScript support** and proper type definitions
- **Compatible with current Effect version** (Effect 3.x)

#### For Articles and Tutorials
- **Original content** - No duplicate or very similar content
- **Practical value** - Should teach something useful or provide insights
- **Current information** - Content should be relevant to modern Effect-TS

#### For Examples and Case Studies
- **Complete and working** examples
- **Real-world applicability** 
- **Well-commented code**
- **Demonstrates Effect best practices**

### What NOT to Include

- **Work-in-progress** or incomplete resources
- **Personal websites** without substantial Effect-TS content
- **Promotional content** or spam
- **Duplicate resources** that cover the same ground as existing entries
- **Outdated content** that refers to old Effect versions without migration notes
- **Resources behind paywalls** without exceptional justification

## Formatting Guidelines

### Resource Entry Format
```markdown
[Resource Name](https://example.com) - Brief description explaining the unique value proposition
```

### Category Descriptions
When adding new categories, include a brief description of what belongs in that category.

### Link Preferences
1. **GitHub repositories** over npm packages (for transparency and additional context)
2. **Official documentation** over third-party explanations
3. **Original sources** over aggregators or mirrors
4. **Stable URLs** that are likely to persist

1. **Search existing resources** to avoid duplicates
2. **Fork the repository**
3. **Create a new branch** for your contribution
4. **Add your resource** following the formatting guidelines
5. **Test all links** to ensure they work
6. **Write a clear commit message** explaining what you're adding
7. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - A descriptive title
   - Brief explanation of why the resource is valuable
   - Confirmation that it meets the quality standards

## Review Process

- **Maintainer review** - All submissions are reviewed by maintainers
